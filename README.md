As a part of DeepLearning & Natural language processing course we chose to create a snake game using pygame, and implement different 
methods of DL & ML to create an AI which can learn how to play by itself.
The models:
Simple SoftMax logistic regression
MLP with hidden layers
Reinforcement learning (RL)
